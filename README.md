Machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent transactions
This is a Machine Learning Project to detect Fraudulent Transactions, the data set is highly imbalanced. 
The approach of the project includes:
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing 
2. Univariate and Bivariate analysis
3. Exploratory Data Analysis.
4. Creating Machine Learning Models.
5. Testing Models and selecting best model.
